## ðŸŽ¯ What's This About?

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical programming problems. These are my solutions written in C++ with one goal: **solve it quickly and move on**.

## ðŸ’¡ My Approach

- Write code that works
- Optimize for speed when needed  
- No over-engineering
- Get the answer, learn something, next problem

## ðŸ“Š Progress

Currently solving problems as I find time. Each solution aims to run in under 1 second.
